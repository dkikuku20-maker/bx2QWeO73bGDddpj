    "This project builds a system to **rank candidates** for a role and **update the ranking** when a recruiter provides feedback by starring a candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "Each row represents one candidate and includes:\n",
    "- `id` – unique identifier  \n",
    "- `job_title` – candidate’s role (text)  \n",
    "- `location` – candidate location  \n",
    "- `connection` – number of professional connections  \n",
    "- `fit` – desired target (not provided in the dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    " Since the `fit` column has no labels, a supervised model cannot be trained.  \n",
    "Instead, a **fit score** is created using text similarity and recruiter feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Initial Ranking\n",
    "- Compare each candidate’s job title with role keywords  \n",
    "  (“Aspiring human resources”, “Seeking human resources”, “HR”)  \n",
    "- Use TF-IDF and cosine similarity  \n",
    "- Rank candidates by similarity score (0–1)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Light Filtering\n",
    "- Remove obvious non-HR technical roles  \n",
    "- Keep unclear cases to avoid losing strong candidates\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Recruiter Feedback \n",
    "- A recruiter stars a candidate they consider a strong fit  \n",
    "- The starred candidate is treated as an ideal example\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 4. Re-Ranking After Feedback\n",

    "\n",
    "This keeps role relevance dominant while learning from feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "Because true labels are not available, improvement is measured by:\n",
    "- Increased similarity of top candidates to the starred profile  \n",
    "- Stable keyword relevance after re-ranking  \n",
    "- More candidates similar to the starred one appearing in the top results  \n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the ranking improves without overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cut-Off Strategy\n",
    "- Use a **Top-K approach (K = 50)**  \n",
    "- Works across roles and avoids hiding high-potential candidates\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a candidate ranking system that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ranks candidates using text similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learns from recruiter feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improves ranking over time\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remains simple, transparent, and explainable\n",
    "\n",
